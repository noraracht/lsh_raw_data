# Access to the data used for CONSULT benchmarking

This repository contains raw data and output reports we used for the study.

* Query summary reports used for sensitivity analysis of different tools:
    - [tools comparison](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/tools_comparison)

* Runtime comparison of different tools:
    - [Drosophila queries](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/runtime/dros_queries)
    - [TOL queries](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/runtime/tol_queries)


* Query summary reports for GORG samples searched against TOL, GTDB and Bact/Arch Kraken using CONSULT:
    - [*m* = 3, *c* = 1](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/gorg_p3c1_consult)
    - [*m* = 3, *c* = 2](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/gorg_p3c2_consult)
    - [*m* = 4, *c* = 2](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/gorg_p4c2_consult)

* Query summary reports for GORG samples searched against TOL, GTDB and Bact/Arch Kraken using Kraken:
    - [conf = 0.00](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/gorg_conf0.00_kraken)
    - [conf = 0.02](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/gorg_conf0.02_kraken)
    - [conf = 0.05](https://github.com/noraracht/lsh_raw_data/tree/main/gorg_conf0.05_kraken)
    
* False positives results evaluated with plant queries searched against TOL, GTDB and Bact/Arch Kraken with different settings:
    - [kraken TBD]()
    - [consult TBD]()
    
* Extended parameter titration performed with GORG samples queried using GTDB with different settings:
    - p3, p4, p5, p6 TBD
    - c1, c2, c3, c4 TBD
    
* Filtering of real Drosophila genome skims: TBD
